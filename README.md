# Comic Strip Writer with Generative AI and Google Gemini
By: Justin Kpana - Isaac Younes - Carl Forman
* This project uses Generative AI (Large Lanuage and Vision Models) to create comic book panels that include both illustrations and dialogue. Users can input a comic topic/prompt and a desired number of panels, and then the system generates matching visuals and text which simulate the skills of a human comic artist and writer.
  
# Problem Statement
* To develop a generative AI system that creates a multi-panel comic strip, when given a prompt and a number of desired panels. Each panel will include a generated image and a dialogue caption which follows narrative consistency throughout.

## Imported Libraries and Modules
* Gemini by Google
* Python
* PIL (Pillow)
* IPython Display
* NumPy
* BAse64
* Wave
* Google Generatiev AI SDK (google.generativeai)

# Model
## Generative Models
* Text Model - Gemini Pro is used to generate:
  * Image scene descrptions for each comic panel
  * Panel dialogue/captions

* Image Model - Gemini 2.0 Flash (experimental image model) is used to generate:
  * Comic-style illustrations from Gemini-generated text prompts

## How the Models Work
* Text Model (Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite) : A large language model (LLM) that processes user input and past context to generate coherent and relevant scene descriptions and dialogue. Suitable for narrative continuity and natural-sounding/flowing comic speech.
* Image Model(Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental Image Generation) : This image generation framework takes input in the form of text and produces a stylized image. Visual output can be guided by enhancing the prompts with more specifics (i.e. "in the comic book style of Spiderman"). The system processes the description, applies learned visual patterns, and synthesizes an illustration that matches in comic-style.

* The generative system applies a sequence of steps necessary for content creation:
  1. Text prompt input by user ("What should we make a comic about: "; "How many panels should it be: ")
  2. Image scene description generated via Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite
  3. Comic-style image generatred from scene description using Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental Image Generation
  4. Caption/dialogue generated using Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite
  5. All outputs are conclusively displayed inline for user review

# System Features
* Interactive Story Prompting - User-driven input for omic topic and panel count
* Conext-Aware Generation - Panel content builds upon prior panels for narrative consistency
* Comic-Style Image Generation - Each panel includes:
  * Unique AI-generated image with visual consistency and comic tone
  * Matching caption/dialogue bubble text generated by LLM
* Panel Expansion - Users can optionally add more panels after viewing current panels
* Multi-Turn AI Context Tracking - System preserves and references previous panels and captions during generation
* Stylistic Prompting - Prompts steer visual output toward comic styles that are recognizable
* Offline Operation - All logic is executed as a Python script without requiring a web server

# Results
* Gemini models are capable of effectively hnadling storytelling progression when previous content is used as input
* The comic generation feels cohesive and creatively authentic
* The system is capable of simulating a co-creative storytelling process between user and AI.

## Limitations
* Character appearance may shift across panels without identity tracking
* Generated images and dialogue may be ocassionally mismatched or lacking of emotional depth
* There is no persistent memory of characters and setings across sessions

# Identical System with Text-to-Speech Capabilities
A version of the comic strip generator includes built-in text-to-speech (TTS) functionality, using Gemini's speech generation model. This enhanced version:

 * Converts each panel's caption into speech using gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts.

 * Utilizes a configurable voice profile (e.g., "Kore") via VoiceConfig.

 * Exports audio as WAV files using the wave module.

 * Automatically plays back the narration after displaying the panel.

 * Adds multimodal storytelling features that enhance user experience and accessibility.

 * Benefits visually impaired users or those who prefer auditory storytelling.

 * Supports modular audio generation, allowing future implementation of multiple voices per character.

This variant is built from the same Python architecture and requires only minor extensions to the core logic for TTS integration.
